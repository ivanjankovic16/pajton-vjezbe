# Write a program that asks the user how many Fibonnaci numbers 
# to generate and then generates them. Take this opportunity to 
# think about how you can use functions. Make sure to ask the user 
# to enter the number of numbers in the sequence to generate.(Hint: 
# The Fibonnaci seqence is a sequence of numbers where the next number 
# in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers in the 
# sequence. The sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, â€¦)
